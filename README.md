Android Application which takes an input image and extracts text from the input image. Makes use of the Tess-Two API for tesseract and the CropImage Api for cropping the camera Image. This code was written in eclipse earlier when NDK support on android-studio was limited. Now tess-two can be directly imported throught the gradle without using NDK
